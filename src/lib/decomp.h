 * more than dstn. Buffer sizes must stay below 2GB. Can decompress files loaded
 * to the end of a buffer in-place, as long as buffer is larger than the final
 * output size. (Usually just a few bytes, but may be up to (8 + dstn/255) in
 * worst case. Will reliably return an error if buffer was too small.)
 * Returns amount of decompressed bytes, or 0 on error.
